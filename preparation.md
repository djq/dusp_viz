# Workshop Descriptions:

## Open Source Urban Data Management and Visualization 

### Urban Data Management and Visualization
* 10 AM - Noon, Feb. 1
* Instructor: David Quinn, ARCH PHD
* Software: R (r-project.org & rstudio.org), QGIS (qgis.org)

Learn how to gain new insights from urban data through the use of spatial analysis and visualization techniques. Participants will learn methods for exploring datasets and how to create exciting visualizations in a hands-on environment. We will also discuss how to generate maps using scripting. The software programs we will use are R and QGIS; both are open-source and run on any operating system. Please fill out this form before the workshop: tinyurl.ie/dusp_viz

### Web-Based Mapping and Data Visualization
* 1 PM - 4 PM, Feb. 1
* Instructor: David Quinn, ARCH PHD
* Software: QGIS (qgis.org), OpenLayers (openlayers.org), Google Fusion Tables (google.com/fusiontables)

Web-based mapping and visualizations are a useful means of sharing information. Participants will learn how to create customized web maps and display data within a browser so that a user can interact with the data presented. QGIS will be used to prepare the data, Google fusion tables will be used to store spatial data, and the Openlayers Javascript library will be used to display the data in a web-browser. A small amount of programming knowledge would be useful, but all steps necessary to produce an interactive web-map will be covered. All software programs used are free or open-source.
